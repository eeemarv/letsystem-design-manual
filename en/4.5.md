Registries are subject to the Data Protection Act.

Registries will find their operations to be much easier if they register
under the Data Protection Act. There is a possible exemption for small
Registries under Exemption 5 (Unincorporate Members’ Clubs). But the
requirements will be quite strict and there is always the risk of non-
compliance.

Registration under the Act costs £75 for 3 years (just less than 15p per
week). The following clauses should then be included in the Registry
Agreement:

“I agree to the personal details on this form being held on computer,
and used for maintaining a record of my trading in the system.

NB. Computer repair/maintenance will be carried out by reputable
service personnel who will be advised of the confidential nature of
these records.”
