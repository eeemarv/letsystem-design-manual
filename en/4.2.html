<p>Some observers have noted that LETSystems can be used to evade
taxation and some have drawn unwarranted conclusions. There is a
prevalent perception that government is in some way separate from its
community. Most people regret or resent the taxation of their production
and few are satisfied that tax revenues are well spent. Government in turn
seems to wage war on the community to extract its revenue. Hence we
perpetuate a &quot;them and us&quot; scenario without hope of resolution.</p>
<p>Landsman Community Services Ltd. deplores the practice of tax evasion
and will not knowingly lend support to persons who are thus defrauding
their community.  It will continue to recommend to LETSystem
administrators that they clearly advise its membership that local currency
in no way differs from national currency in matters of taxation, and that
persons incurring tax  liabilities through local currency trading are advised
to make appropriate provision.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are ways to set up systems that effectively avoid tax.
Some of these ways are quite legitimate. However, such systems will
equally be avoided by business, and as such will only have a limited and
indirect relevance to the mainstream.</p>
<p>We don&apos;t argue that such systems are therefore useless, or risky, or
unethical - although some approaches do score 3 out of 3; just that fighting
battles against governments, for whatever justification, should not obstruct
or obscure other approaches that make the best of the current rules.</p>
<p>Certainly, we should work to change tax laws, but it would be a mistake to
commit all our eggs just to that basket. Fortunately we don&apos;t have to; we
can establish as many systems as we like.</p>
<p>We will have our cake - a sensible tax structure - in the end, but we can
also eat it and like it right now.  &quot;I never yet turned down earnings just
because of the tax I would have to pay.  I can live with cash taxes on local
currency trading better than I can handle taxes with no local currency&quot;.</p>
<p>It is in addition considerably more difficult to deal responsibly with issues
of welfare and other social services - which are much more immediately
relevant to the growth of a LETSystem - if we are seen to be resisting
paying tax.</p>
<h3 id="advice-to-government">Advice to government</h3>
<p>LETSystems are founded on the basis of community self-help and
personal empowerment. Problems within the community are addressed by
the community. Intervention by local and national governments will be
necessary rarely, if at all. Since this approach is different from many other
current initiatives, some guidelines are suggested:</p>
<p><strong>Governments SHOULD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>study - local currencies are going to change dramatically almost all
aspects of government action - revenues, budgets and programs  - so
government has a high need-to-know.</li>
<li>inform internally/externally - in addition to becoming aware of the
situation and the possibilities, governments can and should play a role in
informing the general population, much as they do in matters of public
safety, health care etc.</li>
<li>co-operate, facilitate - in general terms, in any appropriate social change
process, the government role should be to help it along.</li>
<li>underwrite, guarantee loans - financial support can legitimately be
provided through programs of loan guarantees, in support of system
development, but NOT system operation; conventional lenders (banks
etc) have not yet shown much interest in  supporting these ideas.</li>
<li>exempt (partially) earnings of welfare claimants - present social security
arrangements discriminate against claimants who participate in local
currencies, in that they generally lose a &#xA3; of benefit for every &#xA3; they
earn; sliding scales should be implemented, relating on a local basis to
the extent to which &quot;local&quot; earnings can actually be spent to meet
statutory needs.</li>
<li>participate - governments are obliged to perform their function
efficiently, using the tools available; local currencies are available</li>
<li>accept taxes - no good reason not to.</li>
<li>internalize - the interactions of different departments within any
organization, private or public, can be supported by internal currency
system</li>
<li>plan - draw up capital budgets for infrastructure, respond with changes in
ongoing program financing.</li>
<li>issue bonds - government may not directly issue money, but, much as
they borrow &quot;normal&quot; money, they can in some circumstances borrow
local currency</li>
<li>review economic development and trade strategy - governments should
reappraise their position on &quot;growth-and-export-or-die&quot; policies. The
&quot;lean and mean competitive global market&quot; is a dangerous solution to
the current problems. There are better ways to go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Governments SHOULD NOT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>panic - the first response in crisis</li>
<li>overlook - &#x201C;if we don&apos;t think about it it isn&apos;t there&#x201D;.</li>
<li>resist, fight  - quite useless, if you are surrounded.</li>
<li>remain ignorant - very expensive, much more so than getting informed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOR SHOULD THEY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>start systems - it isn&apos;t appropriate to get involved, and direct action will
likely be viewed with great suspicion.</li>
<li>make grants, subsidise - LETSystems are inherently profitable, if
properly operated, and it does not serve to support inefficiency; there
are better ways to provide financial support..</li>
<li>commit - governments may NOT issue local money, since they are, in all
relevant respects, &quot;irresponsible&quot; institutions (no-one can guarantee to
keep their promises)</li>
<li>dominate - government accounts could easily become the highest volume
traders in any system and might thus tend to skew and destabilize; the
prohibition against commitment by government will reduce this risk, as
they can only spend what they are given, but even with this limitation,
LETSystem stewards must be wary.</li>
</ul>
