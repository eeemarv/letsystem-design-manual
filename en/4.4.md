{% block page %}4.4 Liability{% endblock %}

Liability is, at present, entirely a matter for the two individuals who are
making the trade.  The LETSystem information services only acts as a
kind of "Yellow Pages" and does not get involved. The Registry
administration does not involved either.  Many LETSystem exchanges
are of a social rather than a business nature, so business legislation may
not apply (e.g. Sale of Goods, Trading Standards etc ).

In the case of work-exchange organisations like WWOOF, farms are
business premises and so need the insurance.  But what if I'm just
helping my neighbour with the decorating and the ladder breaks?  Many
household insurance policies offer personal (non-business) liability
insurance, which would be appropriate for most LETSystem trades.

For the more commercial type of transactions, most traders and
businesses will have public liability anyway.  Again, is the key point
whether you are supplying something in connection with your normal
trade or profession (a business transaction, public liability, taxable etc)
or whether you are doing social favours or hobbies (social transaction,
personal liability, not taxable)?

Developing the point, a LETSystem exchange can be considered as a
contract between two individuals. Contract law will apply. Should you
want to apply it, of course.
