Existing regulations on taxation, Social Security etc are as relevant to local 
money  as 19th century transport regulations were to the first aircraft.  
Landsman Community Services Ltd will persist in bringing to the attention 
of national and  local authorities:
 
* the benefits that will be realized by communities everywhere 
establishing their own LETSystems, and
* that these benefits can be greatly enhanced by minor amendments 
to current legislation.

Our immediate direction will be to open discussion on principles that local 
LETS credits are:

* a) liable for tax assessment and should thus be payable for tax 
commitments, and
* b) only partially applicable to necessities and hence their receipt should 
not necessarily entail reduction of Social Security entitlement.
